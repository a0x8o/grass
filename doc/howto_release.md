Confirm that you are on the right branch and have no local changes
and that you have no local unpushed commits:

```bash
# Should show no changes:
git status
# Should give no output at all:
git diff
git diff --staged
# Should give no output:
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD

git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now you can merge (or rebase) updates from the remote your local branch
and optionally update your own fork:

```bash
git merge upstream/releasebranch_8_2 && git push origin releasebranch_8_2
```

Verify the result:

```bash
# Should give no output:
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now or any time later, you can use `git log` and `git show` to see the latest
commits and the last commit including the changes.

```bash
git log --max-count=5
git show
```

## Update VERSION file to release version number

Modify the VERSION file use the dedicated script, for RC1, e.g.:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py status
./utils/update_version.py rc 1
```

The script will compute the correct version string and print a message
containing it into the terminal (e.g., "version: GRASS GIS 8.2.0RC1").

Commit with a commit message suggested by the script, e.g.:

```bash
git diff
git commit include/VERSION -m "version: GRASS GIS 8.2.0RC1"
```

Check that there is exactly one commit on your local branch and that it is the
version change:

```bash
git status
git show
```

Push the tag to the upstream repo:

```bash
git push upstream
```

## Create variables

For convenience, create Bash variables with the version update script:

```bash
# Get VERSION and TAG as variables.
eval $(./utils/update_version.py status --bash)
```

git log upstream/releasebranch_8_4..HEAD
# There should be no commits which are not visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now you can rebase updates from the remote your local branch.
Above, you confirmed you have no local commits, so this should happen
without rebasing any local commits, i.e., it should just add the new commits:

```bash
git rebase upstream/releasebranch_8_4
=======
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now you can merge (or rebase) updates from the remote your local branch
and optionally update your own fork:

```bash
git merge upstream/releasebranch_8_2 && git push origin releasebranch_8_2
>>>>>>> 6cf60c76a4 (wxpyimgview: explicit conversion to int (#2704))
```

Verify the result:

```bash
# Should give no output:
<<<<<<< HEAD
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_4..HEAD
git log HEAD..upstream/releasebranch_8_4
# Should give exactly the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now or any time later, you can use `git status`, `git log`, and `git show`
to see a branch, latest commits and a last commit including the changes.

```bash
git status
git log --max-count=5
git show
```

## Update VERSION file to release version number

For RCs, modify the VERSION file use the dedicated script. E.g., for RC1:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py status
./utils/update_version.py rc 1
```

For a release, change the version after the RC cycle to an official release:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py release
```

The script will compute the correct version string and print a message
containing it into the terminal (e.g., "version: GRASS GIS 3.5.0RC1").

Commit with a commit message suggested by the script, e.g.:

```bash
git diff
git commit include/VERSION -m "..."
```

If you lost the script output with the suggested message use
`./utils/update_version.py suggest` to get it.

Check that there is exactly one commit on your local branch and that it is the
version change:

```bash
git status
git show
```

Push the commit to the upstream repo:

```bash
git push upstream
```

## Create variables

For convenience, create Bash variables with the version update script:

```bash
# Get VERSION and TAG as variables.
eval $(./utils/update_version.py status --bash)
```

=======
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now or any time later, you can use `git log` and `git show` to see the latest
commits and the last commit including the changes.

```bash
git log --max-count=5
git show
```

## Update VERSION file to release version number

Modify the VERSION file use the dedicated script, for RC1, e.g.:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py status
./utils/update_version.py rc 1
```

git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now you can merge (or rebase) updates from the remote your local branch
and optionally update your own fork:

```bash
git merge upstream/releasebranch_8_2 && git push origin releasebranch_8_2
```

Verify the result:

```bash
# Should give no output:
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now or any time later, you can use `git log` and `git show` to see the latest
commits and the last commit including the changes.

```bash
git log --max-count=5
git show
```

## Update VERSION file to release version number

Modify the VERSION file use the dedicated script, for RC1, e.g.:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py status
./utils/update_version.py rc 1
```

git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now you can merge (or rebase) updates from the remote your local branch
and optionally update your own fork:

```bash
git merge upstream/releasebranch_8_2 && git push origin releasebranch_8_2
```

Verify the result:

```bash
# Should give no output:
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now or any time later, you can use `git log` and `git show` to see the latest
commits and the last commit including the changes.

```bash
git log --max-count=5
git show
```

## Update VERSION file to release version number

Modify the VERSION file use the dedicated script, for RC1, e.g.:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py status
./utils/update_version.py rc 1
```

<<<<<<< HEAD

The script will compute the correct version string and print a message
containing it into the terminal (e.g., "version: GRASS GIS 8.2.0RC1").

Version and tag are the same for all releases:

```bash
echo "$VERSION"
echo "$TAG"
```

If in doubt, run the script without `eval $(...)` to see all the variables created.

## Create release tag

The tag is created locally, while the release draft is created automatically by
GitHub Actions and can be later edited on GitHub. For background on GitHub releases,
see: <https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases>.

### Tag release

Before creating the tag, it is a good idea to see if the CI jobs are not failing.

Some time was needed to run the checks, so before getting back to creating the tag,
confirm that you are on the right branch which is up to date:

```bash
git status
git log --max-count=5
```

For a first RC of a major (X.y.z) and minor (x.Y.z) release, the GitHub API gives
good results for the first release candidate because it contains contributor handles
and can identify new contributors, so use with the _api_ backend, e.g.:

```bash
python ./utils/generate_release_notes.py api releasebranch_8_4 8.3.0 $VERSION
```

#### Micro releases

For micro releases (x.y.Z), GitHub API does not give good results because it uses
PRs while the backports are usually direct commits without PRs.
The _git log_ command operates on commits, so use use the _log_ backend:

```bash
python ./utils/generate_release_notes.py log releasebranch_8_4 8.4.0 $VERSION
```

#### Between RCs and from last RC to final release

In between RCs and between last RC and final release, the *log* backend is useful
for showing updates since the last RC:

```bash
python ./generate_release_notes.py log releasebranch_8_2 8.2.0RC1 $VERSION
```

For the final release, the changes accumulated since the first RC need to be
added manually to the result from the *api* backend.

However, these notes need to be manually edited to collapse related items into
one. Additionally, a _Highlights_ section needs to be added on top with manually
identified new major features for major and minor releases. For all releases, a
_Major_ section may need to be added showing critical fixes or breaking changes
if there are any.

### Modify the release draft

After the automated release job completes, a new release draft will be available
in the GitHub web interface. You can copy-paste the created release notes to
GitHub and further modify as needed.

However, these notes need to be manually edited to collapse related items into one.
Additionally, a _Highlights_ section needs to be added with manually identified new
major features for major and minor releases. For all releases, a _Major_ section
may need to be added showing critical fixes or breaking changes if there are any.

### Modify the release draft

After the automated release job completes, a new release draft will be available in the GitHub
web interface. You can copy-paste the created release notes to GitHub and further modify as needed.

Eventually, commit with the suggested commit message and push, e.g.:

```bash
git show
eval $(./utils/update_version.py status --bash)
git commit include/VERSION -m "version: Back to $VERSION"
git push upstream
```

The message was suggested by the script, but if you lost that output,
you can get the same or similar message again using the script
(the message provided this way is not precise after RCs):

```bash
./utils/update_version.py suggest
```

## Publishing a final release

The published RC releases has the initial release notes (based on locally
auto-generated notes) which need to be refined further:

- add highlights
- verify that the subsections are well sorted

For the final release, edit these draft release again in order to publish it
using the "Publish release" button.

## Upload to OSGeo servers

This part requires extra permissions and needs to be done by one of the
development coordinators.

### Update redirects

For final minor and major releases (not release candidates and micro releases),
update `grass-stable` redirect at `osgeo7-grass`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

Load the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

For new branches: Update `grass-devel` using the steps above.

## Update winGRASS related files

Update the GRASS version at <https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts>:

- On major or minor version change (on release branch creation) update
  [dev_packages.csv](https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/blob/master/dev_packages.csv)
- On release (inluding RC) update
  [releases.csv](https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/blob/master/releases.csv)
  and
  [grass_packager_release.bat](https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/blob/master/grass_packager_release.bat#L12)

Example for 8.3.0RC1: [commit](https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/commit/c47b0f30051108bd2e8b52d183e97930c24dfafd)

## Update binary and addon builders

Add the new version to repos which build or test addons:

- <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/blob/grass8/.github/workflows/ci.yml>
  (currently, for new branches only)
- <https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/blob/master/grass_addons.sh>
  (add new release related line for new branches and final releases)
