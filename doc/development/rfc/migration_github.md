GRASS GIS is an open source geoinformation system which is developed by a globally
distributed team of developers. Besides the source code developers also message
translators, people who write documentation, those who report bugs and wishes and

The centralized source code management system Subversion (SVN) has served the
GRASS GIS project very well since 2007. The project has established routines and
infrastructure (code repository, ticketing system, developer wiki) connected to
SVN. However, with an increasing number of Open Source developers using git (and
here especially the success of GitHub), time has come to migrate the source code
base from SVN kindly hosted by OSGeo to GitHub.com, a widely adopted development
platform.

GRASS GIS is an open source geoinformation system which is developed by a globally distributed team of developers. Besides the source code developers also message translators, people who write documentation, those who report bugs and wishes and more are involved.

The centralized source code management system Subversion (SVN) has served the GRASS GIS project very well since 2007. The project has established routines and infrastructure (code repository, ticketing system, developer wiki) connected to SVN. However, with an increasing number of Open Source developers using git (and here especially the success of GitHub), time has come to migrate the source code base from SVN kindly hosted by OSGeo to GitHub.com, a widely adopted development platform.

GRASS GIS is an open source geoinformation system which is developed by a globally distributed team of developers. Besides the source code developers also message translators, people who write documentation, those who report bugs and wishes and more are involved.

The centralized source code management system Subversion (SVN) has served the GRASS GIS project very well since 2007. The project has established routines and infrastructure (code repository, ticketing system, developer wiki) connected to SVN. However, with an increasing number of Open Source developers using git (and here especially the success of GitHub), time has come to migrate the source code base from SVN kindly hosted by OSGeo to GitHub.com, a widely adopted development platform.

GRASS GIS project very well since 2007. The project has established routines and
infrastructure (code repository, ticketing system, developer wiki) connected to
SVN. However, with an increasing number of Open Source developers using git (and
here especially the success of GitHub), time has come to migrate the source code
base from SVN kindly hosted by OSGeo to GitHub.com, a widely adopted development

GRASS GIS is an open source geoinformation system which is developed by a globally distributed team of developers. Besides the source code developers also message translators, people who write documentation, those who report bugs and wishes and more are involved.

The centralized source code management system Subversion (SVN) has served the GRASS GIS project very well since 2007. The project has established routines and infrastructure (code repository, ticketing system, developer wiki) connected to SVN. However, with an increasing number of Open Source developers using git (and here especially the success of GitHub), time has come to migrate the source code base from SVN kindly hosted by OSGeo to GitHub.com, a widely adopted development platform.

GRASS GIS is an open source geoinformation system which is developed by a globally distributed team of developers. Besides the source code developers also message translators, people who write documentation, those who report bugs and wishes and more are involved.

The centralized source code management system Subversion (SVN) has served the GRASS GIS project very well since 2007. The project has established routines and infrastructure (code repository, ticketing system, developer wiki) connected to SVN. However, with an increasing number of Open Source developers using git (and here especially the success of GitHub), time has come to migrate the source code base from SVN kindly hosted by OSGeo to GitHub.com, a widely adopted development platform.

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been
[created](https://github.com/grass-svn2git). Note that the "cut-off" date of the
main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)
* repository **grass-addons**
  * repository for addons
  * code re-organized from directory-like layout (grass6, grass7) into
    branches-like layout (master == grass7, grass6, ...)

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been
[created](https://github.com/grass-svn2git). Note that the "cut-off" date of the
main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)
* repository **grass-addons**
  * repository for addons
  * code re-organized from directory-like layout (grass6, grass7) into

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been
[created](https://github.com/grass-svn2git). Note that the "cut-off" date of the
main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main

available in read-only mode.

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been

main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been
[created](https://github.com/grass-svn2git). Note that the "cut-off" date of the
main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)
* repository **grass-addons**

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been
[created](https://github.com/grass-svn2git). Note that the "cut-off" date of the
main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)
* repository **grass-addons**
  * repository for addons
  * code re-organized from directory-like layout (grass6, grass7) into

Since migration is a huge effort, massive work on converting the existing source
code (organized in branches) and the related trac tickets has been done. The main
scope of weeks of efforts was to preserve as much information as possible by
converting trac/svn references to full URLs pointing to the old system kept
available in read-only mode.

The following new GitHub repositories have been
[created](https://github.com/grass-svn2git). Note that the "cut-off" date of the
main **grass** repository does not correspond to the first upload to CSV which
was then migrated to SVN. The repositories **grass** and **grass-legacy** overlap
in time since they contain different branches:

* repository **grass**
  * Source code from 2008 (as the starting commit r31142 was selected, i.e.
    "Welcome to GRASS 7.0.svn") to present day (SVN-trunk -> git-master)
  * i.e., all 7.x and later release branches + master
* repository **grass-legacy**
  * Source code from 1987 (pre-public internet times; manually reconstructed) -
    2018 (r72361 - last commit to releasebranch_6_4)
  * i.e., a separate repository for older GRASS GIS releases (3.2, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)
* repository **grass-addons**
  * repository for addons
  * code re-organized from directory-like layout (grass6, grass7) into

  * see here for the [author mapping table](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass-addons/tools/svn2git/)

**Important**: nothing is lost as contributions can be
[claimed](https://help.github.com/en/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user)
in GitHub.

## Activating the GitHub issue tracker

As the cut-off date for the trac migration we selected 2007-12-09 (r25479) as it
was the first SVN commit (after the years in CVS).

The tickets migrated from trac to GitHub contain updated links in the ticket texts:

* links to other tickets (closed now pointing to full trac URL, open pointing to
  a new github issues). Note that there were many styles of referring in the
  commit log message which had to be parsed accordingly.

## Rules and best practices for using Git

Before the new Git repository is open for writing, we need to have rules and best
practices for dealing with the following:

* Policy for automatic merge commits due to un-synchronous nature of Git. Do we
  want to avoid those by `git pull --rebase`?
* How to do backports?
* A branch for every feature or bug fix in the main repo or is this done in the
  fork?

## Rules and best practices for using Git

Before the new Git repository is open for writing, we need to have rules and best
practices for dealing with the following:

  want to avoid those by `git pull --rebase`?
* How to do backports?

## Rules and best practices for using Git

Before the new Git repository is open for writing, we need to have rules and best
practices for dealing with the following:

* Policy for automatic merge commits due to un-synchronous nature of Git. Do we
  want to avoid those by `git pull --rebase`?
* How to do backports?
<<<<<<< HEAD
* A branch for every feature or bug fix in the main repo or is this done in the fork?

## Rules and best practices for using Git

Before the new Git repository is open for writing, we need to have rules and best
practices for dealing with the following:

  want to avoid those by `git pull --rebase`?
* How to do backports?

## Rules and best practices for using Git

Before the new Git repository is open for writing, we need to have rules and best
practices for dealing with the following:

* Policy for automatic merge commits due to un-synchronous nature of Git. Do we
  want to avoid those by `git pull --rebase`?
* How to do backports?
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD

The proposed solution is

* GitLab has an import module from GitHub.
  * implement a continuous mirror on GitLab.com including the issues and wiki.
    * OSGeo-gitea code mirror: <https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/grass_gis/grass>
  * See <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/repository_mirroring.html>
    * The mirroring is only for the repository, not the issues or wiki.
