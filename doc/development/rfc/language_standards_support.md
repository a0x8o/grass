The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code
(ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these
languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however,
no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to
update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for
contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

This RFC aims at setting a policy for GRASS GIS project regarding language
standard support for C and C++.

In addition, this is also intended to set a precedent for future updates on this
subject.

## Background

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The small amount of C++ code in GRASS GIS has never been formalised and
officially made to conform to any specific standard.

See also the discussion leading to this RFC on the mailing list
[thread](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-January/094899.html).

## Discussion

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also
with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was
done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may
provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code
(ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these
languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however,
no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to
update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for
contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

This RFC aims at setting a policy for GRASS GIS project regarding language
standard support for C and C++.

In addition, this is also intended to set a precedent for future updates on this
subject.

## Background

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The small amount of C++ code in GRASS GIS has never been formalised and
officially made to conform to any specific standard.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code
(ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these
languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however,
no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to
update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for
contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

This RFC aims at setting a policy for GRASS GIS project regarding language
standard support for C and C++.

In addition, this is also intended to set a precedent for future updates on this
subject.

## Background

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The small amount of C++ code in GRASS GIS has never been formalised and
officially made to conform to any specific standard.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also
with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was
done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may
provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The small amount of C++ code in GRASS GIS has never been formalised and
officially made to conform to any specific standard.

## Discussion

<<<<<<< HEAD
It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

This RFC aims at setting a policy for GRASS GIS project regarding language
standard support for C and C++.

In addition, this is also intended to set a precedent for future updates on this
subject.

## Background

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

This RFC aims at setting a policy for GRASS GIS project regarding language
standard support for C and C++.

In addition, this is also intended to set a precedent for future updates on this
subject.

## Background

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also
with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was
done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may
provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code
(ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these
languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however,
no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to
update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for
contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

This RFC aims at setting a policy for GRASS GIS project regarding language
standard support for C and C++.

In addition, this is also intended to set a precedent for future updates on this
subject.

## Background

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The small amount of C++ code in GRASS GIS has never been formalised and
officially made to conform to any specific standard.

Throughout its long history, soon 40 years, GRASS GIS has evolved and steps have
been taken to adapt and modernize. The latest big modernization of the C code
was done in 2002–2006 ([summary](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2021-February/094955.html)),
when it was updated to conform to C89 (ANSI C) standard. A major job, which has
payed-off well. However, during the years, language features of successive
standards have slipped into the code base, which is no longer strictly C89
(nor C90) conformant. There are no compelling reasons to revert the existing
code to strict C89, therefore the community has to decide which standard to
adhere to.

The small amount of C++ code in GRASS GIS has never been formalised and
officially made to conform to any specific standard.

## Discussion

<<<<<<< HEAD
It should be emphasized that existing GRASS GIS C and C++ code compiles also with C17 and C++17. There is therefore no need to modernize it the way it was done to C in the 2000’s. Nevertheless, conforming to newer standards may provide better cross platform support and possibly safer code.

The advantage of having clearly stated policy on language standard
requirements/support is important not only for contributors, but also sets the
frame for supported platforms. For the latter, also the reverse is true: in
deciding supported standard the community needs to consider the degree of
support of standards for various platforms.

The code base of GRASS GIS consists today (Feb. 2021) of predominantly C code (ca 50 %), Python (ca 30 %) and a smaller amount of C++ (ca 5 %). Each of these languages have evolved significantly in the last 10–20 years. There is, however, no clearly stated policy of supported language standard(s), nor mechanism to update this policy when needed or wanted. This result in uncertainty for contributors for what may be allowed and solutions that may not be optimal.

Regarding C, there are three standards that may be considered: C99, C11 and
C17. C99 never really reached full support on key platforms, this is
particularly the case for Windows
([Visual Studio 2013](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c99-library-support-in-visual-studio-2013/)).
Partly in consequence of this lack of support for some C99 features, the C11
standard was made less strict: making some C99 mandatory features optional.
Thus, from autumn 2020 even
[MSVC complies to C11](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c11-and-c17-standard-support-arriving-in-msvc/)
core feature support. Starting with
[GCC 4.9](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/C11Status) it had “substantially
complete” support for C11, Clang from
[version 3.1](https://releases.llvm.org/3.1/docs/ClangReleaseNotes.html).
[C17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C17_(C_standard_revision)), on the other
hand, doesn’t add new features compared to C11. Its difference is more
interesting from compiler point of view, whereas code “good for C11” is
good for C17.

Regarding C++, there are the C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards to

until compelling reasons argue otherwise, the C++11 standard should be policy of
the GRASS GIS project.

Regarding C++, there are the C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards to consider. The platform and compiler support for all of these are significantly better. However, C++11 is at this date in general considered the standard and until compelling reasons argue otherwise, the C++11 standard should be policy of the GRASS GIS project.

Regarding C++, there are the C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards to consider. The platform and compiler support for all of these are significantly better. However, C++11 is at this date in general considered the standard and until compelling reasons argue otherwise, the C++11 standard should be policy of the GRASS GIS project.

Regarding C++, there are the C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards to consider. The platform and compiler support for all of these are significantly better.
