/*!
 * \brief Build topo for area from lines
 *
 * Area is built in clockwise order.
 * Take a given line and start off to the RIGHT/LEFT and try to complete
 * an area.
 *
 * Possible Scenarios:
 *  - I.    path runs into first line.                              : AREA!
 *  - II.   path runs into a dead end (no other area lines at node) : no area
 *  - III.  path runs into a previous line that is not 1st line or to 1st line
 * but not to start node : no area
 *
 * After we find an area then we call point_in_area() to see if the
 * specified point is w/in the area
 *
 * Old returns  -1:  error   0:  no area    (1:  point in area)
 *              -2: island  !!
 *
 * \param[in] plus pointer to Plus_head structure
 * \param[in] first_line line id of first line
 * \param[in] side side of line to build area on (GV_LEFT | GV_RIGHT)
 * \param[in] lines pointer to array of lines
 *
 * \return  -1 on error
 * \return   0 no area
 * \return   number of lines
