   \brief Extend lines in given threshold

   id1   \             ->       \
   \

   2. Extend both lines
   \                      \
   id1   \             ->       \
   \
   id2        ---                 +----


   3. Extend first line when both are on the same line
   id1 ---    --- id2  ->    -----+----


   4. Connect two parallel lines (parallel=1)
   id1 ------                -------
   ->         /
   id2     ------                +-----


   5. Don't connect two parallel lines (parallel=0)
   id1 ------                ------
   ->
   id2     ------                ------

   \param List list of selected lines
   \param nodes 1 for start node, 2 for end node, other for both
   \param parallel connect parallel lines
   \param thresh threshold value
