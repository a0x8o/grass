   \brief Vector library - constraints for reading features

   Higher level functions for reading/writing/manipulating vectors.

   These routines can affect the Vect_read_next_line() functions by
   restricting what they return. They are applied on a per map basis.

   These do not affect the lower level direct read functions.

   Normally, all 'Alive' lines will be returned unless overridden by
   this function. You can specified all the types you are interested
   in (by oring their types together). You can use this to say exclude
   'boundary' type features.

   By default all DEAD lines are ignored by the Vect_read_next_line()
   functions. This too can be overridden by including their types.
