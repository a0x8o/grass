   \brief Calculates z coordinate for point from TIN

   \param Map pointer to vector map
   \param tx,ty point coordinates
   \param[out] tz z-coordinate of point
   \param[out] angle angle (unsupported)
   \param[out] slope slope (unsupported)

   \return 1 on success,
   \return 0 point is not in area,
   \return -1 area has not 4 points or has island
