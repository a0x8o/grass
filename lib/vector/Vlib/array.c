   \brief Set values in 'varray' to 'value' from category string.

   If category of object of given type is in <em>cstring</em> (string
   representing category list like: '1,3,5-7'). <em>type</em> may be
   either: GV_AREA or: GV_POINT | GV_LINE | GV_BOUNDARY | GV_CENTROID

   Array is not reset to zero before, but old values (if any > 0) are
   overwritten.  Array must be initialised by Vect_new_varray() call.

   \param cstring pointer to string with categories
   \param type feature type
   \param value value to set up
   \param[out] varray varray structure to modify

   \return number of items set
   \return -1 on error

   \brief Set values in 'varray' to 'value' from category list

   If category of object of given type is in <em>clist</em> (category
   list).  <em>type</em> may be either: GV_AREA or: GV_POINT | GV_LINE
   | GV_BOUNDARY | GV_CENTROID

   Array is not reset to zero before, but old values (if any > 0) are
   overwritten.  Array must be initialised by Vect_new_varray() call.

   \param Map vector map
   \param field layer number
   \param clist list of categories
   \param type feature type
   \param value value to set up
   \param[out] varray varray structure to modify

   \return number of items set
   \return -1 on error
