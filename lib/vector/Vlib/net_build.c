   \brief Build network graph with turntable.

   Internal format for edge costs is integer, costs are multiplied
   before conversion to int by 1000 and for lengths LL without geo flag by
   1000000. The same multiplication factor is used for nodes. Costs in database
   column may be 'integer' or 'double precision' number >= 0 or -1 for infinity
   i.e. arc or node is closed and cannot be traversed If record in table is not
   found for arcs, costs for arc are set to 0. If record in table is not found
   for node, costs for node are set to 0.

   \param Map vector map
   \param ltype line type for arcs
   \param afield arc costs field (if 0, use length)
   \param nfield node costs field (if 0, do not use node costs)
   \param tfield field where turntable is attached
   \param tucfield field with unique categories used in the turntable
   \param afcol column with forward costs for arc
   \param abcol column with backward costs for arc (if NULL, back costs =

   \brief Build network graph.

   Internal format for edge costs is integer, costs are multiplied
   before conversion to int by 1000 and for lengths LL without geo flag by
   1000000. The same multiplication factor is used for nodes. Costs in database
   column may be 'integer' or 'double precision' number >= 0 or -1 for infinity
   i.e. arc or node is closed and cannot be traversed If record in table is not
   found for arcs, arc is skip. If record in table is not found for node, costs
   for node are set to 0.

   \param Map vector map
   \param ltype line type for arcs
   \param afield arc costs field (if 0, use length)
   \param nfield node costs field (if 0, do not use node costs)
   \param afcol column with forward costs for arc
   \param abcol column with backward costs for arc (if NULL, back costs =
   forward costs), \param ncol column with costs for nodes (if NULL, do not use
   node costs), \param geo use geodesic calculation for length (LL), \param
