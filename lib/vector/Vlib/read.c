   This function implements sequential access, constraints are
   reflected, see Vect_set_constraint_region(),
   Vect_set_constraint_type(), or Vect_set_constraint_field() for
   details.

   Use Vect_rewind() to reset reading. Topological level is not
   required.

   A warning is printed on failure.

   \param Map pointer Map_info struct
   \param[out] line_p feature geometry (pointer to line_pnts struct)
   \param[out] line_c feature categories (pointer to line_cats struct)

   \return feature type (GV_POINT, GV_LINE, ...)
