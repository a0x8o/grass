/*!
   \brief Read a Well Known Binary (WKB) representation of
   a given feature id.

   This function reads a specific feature and converts it into a
   WKB representation. line_pnts and line_cats structures can be provided
   to store the result of the read operation. That is meaningful in case
   the category values of the feature are needed.
   This function is not thread safe, it uses static variables for speedup.

   Supported feature types:
   - GV_POINT    -> POINT
   - GV_CENTROID -> POINT
   - GV_LINE     -> LINESTRING
   - GV_BOUNDARY -> LINEARRING

   \param Map pointer to Map_info structure
   \param line_p pointer to line_pnts structure to use, or NULL
   \param line_c pointer to line_cats structure to use, or NULL
   \param line The id of the feature to read
   \param size The size of the returned unsigned char array

   \return pointer to unsigned char array
   \return NULL on error
