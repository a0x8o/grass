   \brief Writes the next row for cell/fcell/dcell file

   Writes the next row for the cell file opened on 'fd' from 'buf' All
   writes go into NEW files that exactly match the current window.  The
   file must have been opened with Rast_open_new() and be written
   sequentially, ie no skipping rows.

   When the null values are embedded into the data, corresponding cells
   are changed to 0's and the corresponding null value row is written
   into null file.

   A map cannot be copied using Rast_get_row() and
   Rast_put_row(). The former resamples the data of the original
   map into a row buffer that matches the current window. The later
   writes out rows associated with the window.

   Keeps track of the minimum and maximum cell value for use in
   updating the range file upon close of the cell file.  HOWEVER when
   nulls are not embedded, the cells are considered 0's as far as
   updating range is concerned, even if the corresponding cell is null
   in the resulting null file, so programmer should be carefult to set
   all the null values using Rast_set_null_value() or
   G_insert_d_null_values() or G_insert_f_null_values().
