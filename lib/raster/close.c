 * Raster_Map_Layer_Support_Routines for routines which write raster
 * support files.
 *
 * If the map is a new floating point, move the <tt>.tmp</tt> file
 * into the <tt>fcell</tt> element, create an empty file in the
 * <tt>cell</tt> directory; write the floating-point range file; write
 * a default quantization file quantization file is set here to round
 * fp numbers (this is a default for now). create an empty category
