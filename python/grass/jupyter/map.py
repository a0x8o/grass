class Map:
    """Map creates and displays GRASS maps in
    Jupyter Notebooks.

    Elements are added to the display by calling GRASS display modules.

    Basic usage::

    >>> m = Map()
    >>> m.run("d.rast", map="elevation")
    >>> m.run("d.legend", raster="elevation")
    >>> m.show()

    GRASS display modules can also be called by using the name of module
    as a class method and replacing "." with "_" in the name.

    Shortcut usage::

    >>> m = Map()
    >>> m.d_rast(map="elevation")
    >>> m.d_legend(raster="elevation")
    >>> m.show()
