    """Resolve full path to mapset from given combination of parameters.

    Full or relative path to mapset can be provided as *path*. If the *path*
    points to a valid location instead of a valid mapset, the mapset defaults
    to PERMANENT.

    Alternatively, location and mapset can be provided separately. In that case,
    location and mapset are added to the path. If location is provided and mapset
    is not, mapset defaults to PERMANENT.

    Home represented by ``~`` (tilde) and relative paths are resolved
    and the result contains absolute paths.

    The function does not enforce the existence of the directory or that it
    is a mapset. It only manipulates the paths except for internal checks
    which help to determine the result in some cases. On Windows, if the path
    does not exist and ``..`` is present in the path, it will be not be resolved
    due to path resolution limitation in the Python pathlib package.

    Returns a MapsetPath object.
