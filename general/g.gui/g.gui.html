aka <em><a href="wxGUI.html">wxGUI</a></em> (<b>ui=wxpython</b>) and
command line text-based UI (<b>ui=text</b>).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

If the <b>-d</b> update flag is given or the <tt>GRASS_GUI</tt>
environmental <a href="variables.html">variable</a> is unset, then
the GRASS internal variable <tt>GUI</tt> is permanently changed and
the selected <b>ui</b> will be used as the default UI from then on.

<p>
All GRASS internal variables (see <em><a href="g.gisenv.html">g.gisenv</a></em>)
are stored in the user's home directory in a hidden file called
<tt>$HOME/.grass8/rc</tt> on Unix-based operating systems
and <tt>%APPDATA%\GRASS8\rc</tt> on MS Windows. Note that these GRASS
internal variables are not the shell environment variables and the
<tt>rc</tt> file is not a classic UNIX run command file, it just
contains persistent GRASS variables.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Set default user interface settings</h3>

Set default user interface setting to command line, text-based UI:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.gui -d ui=text
</pre></div>

<p>
Set default user interface setting to the graphical user interface
(GUI) and <i>launch</i> the GUI:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.gui -d ui=wxpython
</pre></div>

<p>
Set default user interface setting to the graphical user interface
(GUI) but <i>do not launch</i> the GUI:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.gui -dn ui=wxpython
</pre></div>

<h3>Load workspace from command line</h3>

Start the GUI from command line with an existing workspace:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.gui workspace=myproject.gxw
</pre></div>
