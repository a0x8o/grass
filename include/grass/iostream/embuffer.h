/****************************************************************************

 *  MODULE:     iostream
 *

 *  COPYRIGHT (C) 2007 Laura Toma
 *
 *

 *  Iostream is a library that implements streams, external memory
 *  sorting on streams, and an external memory priority queue on
 *  streams. These are the fundamental components used in external
 *  memory algorithms.

 * Credits: The library was developed by Laura Toma.  The kernel of
 * class STREAM is based on the similar class existent in the GPL TPIE
 * project developed at Duke University. The sorting and priority
 * queue have been developed by Laura Toma based on communications
 * with Rajiv Wickremesinghe. The library was developed as part of
 * porting Terraflow to GRASS in 2001.  PEARL upgrades in 2003 by
 * Rajiv Wickremesinghe as part of the Terracost project.

 external_memory buffer

 Each level-i buffer can store up to <arity>^i * <basesize> items,
 where typically <arity> is \theta(m) and <basesize> is \theta(M);
 therefore log_m{n/m} buffers are needed to store N items, one
 buffer for each level 1..log_m{n/m}. All buffers must have same
 values or <arity> and <basesize>.

 Functionality:

 A level-i on-disk buffer stores <arity>^i * <basesize> items of
 data, organized in <arity> streams of <arity>^{i-1} items each;
 <basesize> is same for all buffers and equal to the size of the
 level 0 buffer (in memory buffer).

 Invariant: all the <arity> streams of a level-i buffer are in
 sorted order; in this way sorting the buffer is done by merging the
 <arity> streams in linear time.

 Items are inserted in level i-buffer only a whole stream at a time
 (<arity>^{i-1}*<basesize> items). When all the <arity> streams of
 the buffer are full, the buffer is sorted and emptied into a stream
 of a level (i+1)-buffer.

 The <arity> streams of a buffer are allocated contigously from left
 to r ight. The unused streams are NULL; The buffer keeps the index of
 the last used(non-NULL) stream. When a buffer becomes full and is
 empty, all its buffers are set to NULL.
