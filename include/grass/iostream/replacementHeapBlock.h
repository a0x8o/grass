 *

 *  Iostream is a library that implements streams, external memory
 *  sorting on streams, and an external memory priority queue on
 *  streams. These are the fundamental components used in external
 *  memory algorithms.

 * Credits: The library was developed by Laura Toma.  The kernel of
 * class STREAM is based on the similar class existent in the GPL TPIE
 * project developed at Duke University. The sorting and priority
 * queue have been developed by Laura Toma based on communications
 * with Rajiv Wickremesinghe. The library was developed as part of
 * porting Terraflow to GRASS in 2001.  PEARL upgrades in 2003 by
 * Rajiv Wickremesinghe as part of the Terracost project.
