 *  MODULE:     iostream
 *

 *  COPYRIGHT (C) 2007 Laura Toma
 *
 *

 *  Iostream is a library that implements streams, external memory
 *  sorting on streams, and an external memory priority queue on
 *  streams. These are the fundamental components used in external
 *  memory algorithms.

 * Credits: The library was developed by Laura Toma.  The kernel of
 * class STREAM is based on the similar class existent in the GPL TPIE
 * project developed at Duke University. The sorting and priority
 * queue have been developed by Laura Toma based on communications
 * with Rajiv Wickremesinghe. The library was developed as part of
 * porting Terraflow to GRASS in 2001.  PEARL upgrades in 2003 by
 * Rajiv Wickremesinghe as part of the Terracost project.

   Functionality:

   Keep a pqueue PQ of size \theta(M) in memory.  Keep a buffer B0 of
   size \theta(M) in memory.  keep an array of external-memory
   buffers, one for each level 1..log_m{n/m} (where N is the maximum
   number of items in pqueue at any time).

   invariants:
   1. PQ contains the smallest items in the structure.

   2. each stream of any external memory buffers is sorted in
   increasing order.

   insert(x): if (x < maximum_item(PQ) exchange x with
   maximum_item(PQ); if buffer B0 is full, empty it; insert x in B0;

   extract_min():

   analysis:

   1. inserts: once the buffer B0 is empty, the next sizeof(B0)
   inserts are free; one insert can cause many I/Os if cascading
   emptying of external buffers Bi occurs. Emptying level-i buffer
   costs <arity>^i*sizeof(B0)/B I/Os and occurs every
   N/<arity>^i*sizeof(B0) inserts (or less, if deletes too). It can be
   proved that the amortized time of 1 insert is 1/B*maxnb_buffers.
