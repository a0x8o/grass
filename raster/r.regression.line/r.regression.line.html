<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.regression.line</em> calculates a linear regression from two
raster maps, according to the formula
<div class="code"><pre>
y = a + b*x
</pre></div>
where
<div class="code"><pre>
x
y
</pre></div>
represent the input raster maps.
<p>
Optionally, it saves regression coefficients as a ASCII file.
The result includes the following coefficients:
offset/intercept (a) and gain/slope (b), correlation coefficient (R),
number of elements (N), means (medX, medY), standard deviations
(sdX, sdY), and the F test for testing the significance of the
regression model as a whole (F).
