/* INPUT: stream containing the edgelist of watershed adjacency graph

h is the smallest height on the boundary between watershed u and
watershed v;

the outside face is assumed to be watershed number 0

E contains the edges between the watersheds on the boundary and the
outside watershed 0;

E is sorted increasingly by (h,u,v)

OUTPUT: allocate and returns an array raise[1..W-1], raise[i] is the

valid flow path to the outside watershed (raise[0] is 0) */
