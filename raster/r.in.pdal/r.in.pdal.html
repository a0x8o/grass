<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.in.pdal</em> module loads PDAL library supported point clouds
(with emphasis on LiDAR LAS files) into a new
raster map using binning. The user may choose from a variety of
statistical methods which will be used for binning when creating
the new raster.

<p>
Since a new raster map is created during the binning, the binning of
points depends on the current computational region settings
(extent and resolution) by default (see more about binning below).
When using the <b>-e</b> flag, the binning will be done in the extent
of the point cloud, so the resulting raster will have extent based on
the input point cloud.
When the <em>resolution=value</em> parameter is used,
the binning is done using the provided resolution and the resulting
raster will have that resolution (see more below for more information
about extent and resolution management).

<p>
<em>r.in.pdal</em> is designed for processing massive point cloud
datasets, for example raw LiDAR or sidescan sonar swath data.

<h3>Binning</h3>

The main difference between <em>r.in.pdal</em> and
<em><a href="v.in.pdal.html">v.in.pdal</a></em> is that
<em>r.in.pdal</em> creates a raster instead of just importing the
points into GRASS GIS. However, <em>r.in.pdal</em> does not merely
rasterizes the points from the point cloud. <em>r.in.pdal</em>
uses binning to derive values for individual raster cells,
so the value of a cell is typically an aggregation of values
of individual points falling into one cell.

In general binning is the conversion of points into a regular grid.
The binning of points with X and Y coordinates starts with the overlay
of a grid of bins over the points.
<p>
In the basic case, binning is a method which counts the number of
points which fall into one raster cell, i.e. bin. The number of points
per cell (bin) indicates the density of points in the point cloud.
The cell (bin) is always square or rectangular in case of
<em>r.in.pdal</em> because the result is GRASS GIS 2D raster.
The result of binning where the number of point per cell is counted
is sometimes called 2D (two dimensional) histogram because
a histogram is used in univariate statistics (in one dimension)
to count the number samples falling into a given bin.

    Figure: The binning on left was used to count number of points per
    (sometimes also called 2D histogram). The numbers in cells are
    examples of counts, the rest is represented by the color.
    The binning on right was used with mean to create a surface
    based on the values associated with the points. The numbers
    show examples of cell values. Note also the cells without any points
    which were assigned the NULL value.
</em>
</center>

The basic concept of binning is extended when the points have another
value associated with them. For LiDAR data this value can be the Z
coordinate or intensity. The value for a given cell (bin) is computed
using univariate statistics from the values of all points in the cell.
For example, computing the mean value of Z coordinates can yield
a raster representing the digital elevation model. Another example is
the range of Z coordinates which can be used as a rough estimate of
vegetation height.

<h3>Statistics</h3>

Available statistics for populating the output raster map are:

<dl class="option_descriptions">
<dt>n</dt>
<dd>This computes the number (count) of points per cell. The result
is a indicator of spatially variable density of points in the given
area.</dd>
<dt>min</dt>
<dd>This finds the minimum of point values in each cell.
It can be useful when finding topography in a forested or urban
environment and there is a lot of points per one cells (terrain is
oversampled considering the desired resolution).
It can also create surfaces independent on the noise from premature
hits as it will always select the lowest point.
</dd>
<dt>max</dt>
<dd>This finds the maximum of point values in each cell.
In connection with <b>base_raster</b> it can yield maximum vegetation
of feature height per cell.
For this purpose, it is usually much more appropriate than <em>mean</em>
which would yield heights mostly influenced by the vertical
distribution of points.
</dd>
<dt>range</dt>
<dd>This computes the range of point values in each cell.
The range of Z coordinates per cell can be used as a rough estimate of
vegetation height when the cells are small enough, slopes low
and the area is mostly vegetated.
However, for more profound analysis, the base raster together with
different statistics is recommended.</dd>
<dt>sum</dt>
<dd>This computes the sum of point values per cell.
This is useful especially when intensity is used as a value.</dd>
<dt>mean</dt>
<dd>This is a mean (average) value of point values in cell.
When used with Z coordinates (the default) and points from the ground
class, the resulting raster is a digital elevation model.
When intensity is used as a point value, the resulting raster contains
mean intensity per cell.
Note that <em>mean</em> gives heights influenced by the vertical
distribution of points.</dd>
<dt>stddev</dt>
<dd>This computes the standard deviation of point values for each
cell.</dd>
<dt>variance</dt>
<dd>This computes the variance of point values for each cell.
Variance and derivatives use the biased estimator (n).
It is calculated by Welford algorithm.</dd>
<dt>coeff_var</dt>
<dd>This computes the coefficient of variance of point values for each
cell. Coefficient of variance is given in percentage and defined as
<tt>100 * sqrt(variance) / mean</tt>.</dd>
<dt>median</dt>
<dd>This computes the median of point values for each cell</dd>
<dt>mode</dt>
<dd>This computes the mode (the most common value) of point values for each cell.
If there are more than one mode for a cell, an arbitrary one will be selected.</dd>
<dt>percentile</dt>
<dd>p<sup><i>th</i></sup> (nth) percentile of points in cell</dd>
<dt>skewness</dt>
<dd>This is a skewness of point values in cell</dd>
<dt>trimmean</dt>
<dd>This is a trimmed mean of point values in cell.
Trimmed mean also know as truncated mean is a mean
computed after discarding values at the low end and at the high end.
How many values to discard is given by the <b>trim</b> option
in percent. In statistics the usual percentage of trimmed values ranges
from 5 to 25 percent.</dd>
<dt>sidnmax</dt>
<dd>Maximum number of points in cell per source ID.
Points are counted for each source separately and largest count
is used as the final cell value. Corresponds to majority density (<i>Dmax</i>)
as defined by Smeeckaert et al., 2013.</dd>
<dt>sidnmin</dt>
<dd>Minimum number of points in cell per source ID.
Points are counted for each source separately and smallest count
is used as the final cell value. Corresponds to minority density (<i>Dmin</i>)
as defined by Smeeckaert et al., 2013.</dd>
<dt>ev1, ev2, ev3</dt>
<dd>1st, 2nd and 3rd eigenvalue of point x, y and z coordinates within
a cell (Mallet et al. 2011).</dd>
</dl>

Note that different statistics have different memory requirements
(see below for details).

<p>
In varied terrain the user may find that <em>min</em> maps make for a good
noise filter as most LIDAR noise is from premature hits. The <em>min</em> map
may also be useful to find the underlying topography in a forested or urban
environment if the cells are oversampled.

<h3>Filtering and selection</h3>

Points are always filtered by spatial extent (based on current computational
region) unless <em>-e</em> flag is set. Afterwards import value scaling
is performed, followed by filtering by having value in range.

<p>
Points falling outside the current computational region will be skipped.
This includes points falling <em>exactly</em> on the southern or eastern
region bound. To capture those adjust the region with:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region s=s-0.000001
</pre></div>

See <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em> for details about
computation region handling in GRASS GIS.

<p>
The <b>zrange</b> parameter may be used for filtering the input data by
vertical extent. Example uses include
filtering out extreme outliers and outliers on relatively flat terrain.
This parameter can be also used for cutting the point cloud into
vertical sections preparing it for further processing
by separate sections, together as if it would be an imagery group
(see <em><a href="i.group.html">i.group</a></em>), or combined into
a 3D raster using <em><a href="r.to.rast3.html">r.to.rast3</a></em>.
In for these last examples, it might actually be more advantageous
to use <em><a href="r3.in.lidar.html">r3.in.lidar</a></em> module.
The <b>zrange</b> parameter is especially powerful when used
together with the <b>base_raster</b> parameter. The <b>zrange</b>
is applied to Z values after the <b>base_raster</b> reduction.

<center>
<img src="r_in_lidar_zrange.png">
<p><em>
    Figure: This is the principle of zrange filter. Points with the
    Z coordinate value below the lower value in the range (here 180)
    are filtered out (blue points) and same applies for points above
    higher value in the range (here 250). All other points are preserved
    (green points).
</em>
</center>

<p>
Filtering can be performed also on intensity values with <em>irange</em>
parameter. If imported dimension is neither Z nor intensity, filtering
can be performed with <em>drange</em> parameter. Filtering by Z values
and intensity can be performed independently on imported dimension.
If imported dimension is not Z nor intensity, filtering can be performed
with all three parameters simultaneously (<em>zrange</em>, <em>irange</em>
and <em>drange</em>) or any of their combination.

<p>
A LiDAR pulse can have multiple returns. The first return values can be
used to obtain a digital surface model (DSM) where e.g. canopy cover is
represented. The last return values can be used to obtain a digital
terrain model (DTM) where e.g. the forest floor instead of canopy
cover is represented. The <b>return_filter</b> option allows selecting
one of first, mid, or last returns. Return number and number of returns
in the pulse associated with each point are compared to determine
if the point is first, mid, or last return.

<p>
LiDAR points often come as already classified into standardized classes.
For example, class number 2 represents ground. For other classes see
LAS format specification in references. The <b>class_filter</b> option
allows selecting one or more classes using numbers (integers) separated
by comma.

<p>
The user can use a combination of <em>r.in.pdal</em> <b>output</b> maps

<em><a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a></em> to create
a <tt>mean-(2*stddev)</tt> map. (In this example the user may want to
include a lower bound filter in <em>r.mapcalc</em> to remove highly
variable points (small <em>n</em>) or run <em>r.neighbors</em> to
smooth the stddev map before further use.)

<p>
Note that proper filtering of the input points in not only critical for
the analysis itself but it can also speed up the processing.

<p>
LiDAR points can contain a lot of attributes besides their coordinates.
By default <em>r.in.pdal</em> will use point Z coordinate as the output

of various attributes can be found in LAS Specification chapter "Point
Data Records". Be ware - not all attributes might be present and also
their value ranges and meaning might vary between LAS file producers.

<p>
PDAL supports creation of custom dimensions (point attributes) in LAS files.
Use <em>user_dimension</em> option to provide name of any dimension for
import. This option supersedes one specified by <em>dimension</em> option.

<h3>Reduction to a base raster</h3>

<p>
For analysis of features on the terrain surface, especially vegetation
it is advantageous to remove the influence of the terrain on heights
because the height above the terrain is important (e.g. height of
a tree) rather than height of the top of the tree above the see level.
In this case, the base raster would be digital elevation model
which can be one derived from the point cloud, or obtained in
some other way. LiDAR data often come with precomputed DEMs
(quality should be checked in this case) and there is often a DEM
available for a given area (fit with the point cloud, especially
vertical, and resolution should be checked).

<center>
<img src="r_in_lidar_base_raster.png">
<p><em>
    Figure: This is a profile of base raster (in orange) representing
    digital elevation model and selected points, e.g. first return,
    from point cloud (green dots). By default the points would create
    a digital surface model (thin brown line) but after reducing the
    Z coordinates using the base raster, the created surface is a
    derived from the height of points relative to the base raster.
</em>
</center>

The usage of base raster is not limited to digital elevation model.
The base raster can be any surface which has some relation to the
point values, for example digital surface model representing
top of the canopy.

<h3>Setting extent and resolution</h3>

<p>
Since the creation of raster maps depends on the computational
region settings (extent and resolution), as default the current
region extents and resolution are used for the import. When using
the <em>-e</em> flag along with the <em>resolution=value</em>
parameter, the region used for the new raster will be based
the point cloud extent and the provided resolution. It is therefore
recommended to first use the <em>-s</em> flag to get the extents of the
LiDAR point cloud to be imported, then adjust the current region extent
and resolution accordingly, and only then proceed with the actual import.
Another option is to automatically set the region extents based on the
LAS dataset itself (<em>-e</em> flag) along with the desired raster
resolution. The best option is to know the point cloud extent ahead,
e.g. from tiling scheme, and use it. See below for details.

<p>
Since the <em>r.in.pdal</em> generates a raster map through binning
from the original LiDAR points, the target computational region
extent and resolution have to be determined. A typical workflow
would involve the examination of the LAS data's associated
documentation or the scan of the LAS data file with
<em>r.in.pdal</em>'s <b>-g</b> flag to find the input
data's bounds.

<p>
Another option is to automatically set the region extents based on the
LAS dataset extent (<b>-e</b> flag) along with the desired raster
resolution using the <em>resolution</em> parameter.

<p>
The <b>-g</b> flag prints extent of input data set(s) in a shell style
suitable as command line parameters for <em>g.region</em>. Note, extent
is determined from data set(s) metadata and without scanning whole
dataset and thus selectros and filters are not applied.

<p>
A simpler option is to automatically set the region extents based on the
LAS dataset (<b>-e</b> flag) along with the target raster resolution using
the <em>resolution</em> parameter. Also here it is recommended to verify
and optimize the resulting region settings with <em>g.region</em> prior
to importing the dataset.

<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>
Point Z axis values can be altered by scaling parameter set by <em>zscale</em>.
Each point X axis value is multiplied by provided value before any
filtering or further transformation takes place. In the same way act

<h3>LAS file import preparations</h3>

Note that the scanning (<b>-s</b> or <b>-g</b> flags) needs to iterate
over the whole point cloud. This will take a long time for large
datasets, so if the user knows the approximate extent of the dataset,
for example because it dataset for one county or tiling scheme is
available as vector polygons, it is much more advantageous to provide
the extent information instead of retrieving it from the dataset.
The same applies to the <b>-e</b> flag which also needs to perform
scanning before the binning begins.

<p>
Also note that the scanning does not apply any filters, so the
extent determined by scanning can be theoretically bigger than
the extent actively used during the binning.
This behavior ensures that the newly created raster has always
the same extent regardless the filters used.
However, for most cases (considering the point cloud and the resolution
used) there is no difference between the extent without filters applied
and the extent if the filters would be applied.
-->

<h3>Memory consumption</h3>

<p>
While the <b>input</b> file can be arbitrarily large, <em>r.in.pdal</em>
will use a large amount of system memory (RAM) for large raster regions
(&gt; 10000x10000 pixels).
If the module refuses to start complaining that there isn't enough memory,
use the <b>percent</b> parameter to run the module in several passes.
In addition using a less precise map format (<tt>CELL</tt> [integer] or
<tt>FCELL</tt> [floating point]) will use less memory than a <tt>DCELL</tt>
[double precision floating point] <b>output</b> map.
For <b>methods</b>=<em>n, mode, sidnmin, sidnmax</em>, the <tt>CELL</tt>
format is used automatically.

<p>
The <em>mean</em> and <em>range</em> methods will use average amount
of memory (comparing to other methods).
Methods such as <em>n, min, max</em>, and <em>sum</em> will use
less memory,
while <em>stddev, variance</em>, and <em>coeff_var</em> will use more.

<p>
The memory usage for regular statistics mentioned above is based solely
on region (raster) size.
However, the aggregate functions <em>median, mode, percentile, skewness</em>
and <em>trimmean</em> will use more memory and may not be
appropriate for use with arbitrarily large input files without
a small value for the <b>percent</b> option because unlike
the other statistics memory use for these also depends on
the number of data points.

<p>
The default map <b>type</b>=<tt>FCELL</tt> is intended as compromise between
preserving data precision and limiting system resource consumption.

<h3>Trim option</h3>
<p>
Trim option value is used only when calculating trimmed mean values.
Attempt to use it with other statistical methods will result in an error.

<h3>Print flag</h3>
<p>
The <b>-p</b> flag will use PDAL library built-in LAS file metadata
printing function. It will also include a list of supported dimension
names. Any of listed dimensions can be passed to the <b>user_dimension</b>
option. Dimensions are not checked for presence of data for any of points
in the file and thus importing a dimension without actual data will
result in an empty map.

<h3>Finding suitable extent and resolution</h3>

<p>
For the output raster map, a <b>suitable resolution</b> can be found by
dividing the number of input points by the area covered (this requires
an iterative approach as outlined here):

<!-- points.las is from California -->
<div class="code"><pre>
# print LAS metadata (Number of Points)
r.in.pdal -p input=points.las
# Point count: 1287775

# scan for LAS points cloud extent
r.in.pdal -g input=points.las output=dummy -o
# n=2193507.740000 s=2190053.450000 e=6070237.920000 w=6066629.860000 b=-3.600000 t=906.000000

# set computation region to this extent
g.region n=2193507.740000 s=2190053.450000 e=6070237.920000 w=6066629.860000 -p

# print resulting extent
g.region -p
#  rows:       3454
#  cols:       3608

# points_per_cell = n_points / (rows * cols)
# Here: 1287775 / (3454 * 3608) = 0.1033359 LiDAR points/raster cell
# As this is too low, we need to select a lower raster resolution

g.region res=5 -ap
#  rows:       692
#  cols:       723
#  Now: 1287775 / (692 * 723) = 2.573923 LiDAR points/raster cell

# import as mean
r.in.pdal input=points.las output=lidar_dem_mean method=mean -o

# import as max
r.in.pdal input=points.las output=lidar_dem_max method=max -o

# import as p'th percentile of the values
r.in.pdal input=points.las output=lidar_dem_percentile_95 \
           method=percentile pth=95 -o
</pre></div>

<h3>Height above ground</h3>

The mean height above ground of the points can be computed for each
raster cell (the ground elevation is given by the raster map
<tt>elevation</tt>):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation -p
r.in.pdal input=points.las output=mean_height_above_ground base_raster=elevation method=mean
</pre></div>

In this type of computation, it might be advantageous to change the resolution
to match the precision of the points rather than deriving it from the base raster.

path. For example, a list of files in the directory /home/user/data:
<div class="code"><pre>
points1.laz
points2.laz
points3.laz
</pre></div>

would be lised in the file as:
<div class="code"><pre>
/home/user/data/points1.laz
/home/user/data/points2.laz
/home/user/data/points3.laz
</pre></div>
On Linux and OSX, this file can be automatically generated with the command:
<div class="code"><pre>
ls /home/user/data/*.laz > /home/user/data/filelist.txt
</pre></div>
On Windows:
<div class="code"><pre>
dir /b c:\users\user\data\*.laz > c:\users\user\data\filelist.txt
</pre></div>

The mean height above ground example above would then be:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation -p
r.in.pdal file=/home/user/data/filelist.txt output=mean_height_above_ground base_raster=elevation method=mean
</pre></div>

In Python, the list of files can be created using the <em>glob</em>
Python module:

<div class="code"><pre>
import glob
import gscript

file_list_name = '/home/user/data/filelist.txt'
with open(, mode='w') as file_list:
    for path in glob.iglob('/home/user/data/lidar/*.las'):
        file_list.write(path + "\n")

gscript.run_command('r.in.pdal', file=file_list_name,
                    output='mean_height_above_ground',
                    base_raster='elevation' method='mean')
</pre></div>
