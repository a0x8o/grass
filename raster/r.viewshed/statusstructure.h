 * PURPOSE: To calculate the viewshed (the visible cells in the

 * visible to each other.  Two cells are visible to each other if the
 * line-of-sight that connects their centers does not intersect the

 * i.e. if the line-of-sight does not pass through the cell center,
 * elevation is determined using bilinear interpolation.
 * The viewshed algorithm is efficient both in
 * terms of CPU operations and I/O operations. It has worst-case
 * complexity O(n lg n) in the RAM model and O(sort(n)) in the
 * I/O-model.  For the algorithm and all the other details see the
 * paper: "Computing Visibility on * Terrains in External Memory" by
 * Herman Haverkort, Laura Toma and Yi Zhuang.
