 * PURPOSE: To calculate the viewshed (the visible cells in the
 * raster) for the given viewpoint (observer) location.  The
 * visibility model is the following: Two points in the raster are
 * considered visible to each other if the cells where they belong are
 * visible to each other.  Two cells are visible to each other if the
 * line-of-sight that connects their centers does not intersect the
