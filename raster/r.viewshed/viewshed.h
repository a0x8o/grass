 * PURPOSE: To calculate the viewshed (the visible cells in the
 * raster) for the given viewpoint (observer) location.  The
 * visibility model is the following: Two points in the raster are
 * considered visible to each other if the cells where they belong are
 * visible to each other.  Two cells are visible to each other if the
 * line-of-sight that connects their centers does not intersect the

 * i.e. if the line-of-sight does not pass through the cell center,

 * The viewshed algorithm is efficient both in

 * complexity O(n lg n) in the RAM model and O(sort(n)) in the
 * I/O-model.  For the algorithm and all the other details see the
