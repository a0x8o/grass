/* Find 'centroids' of all cats.  Most useful with cats which are
 * like clumps (contiguous areas), but will work on any file.
 * Respects the current window and mask.
 * Category zero and negative categories are not done!
 * Returned centroids are (row, col) pairs in n, e.
 * Returned value is 0 for most cases, > 0 if 'both' method
 * selected and some values fell outside 'clumps', and were
 * adjusted.
 * Two methods can be used: 'distance-weighted' and 'counting'.
 *
 * Method 0 = 'counting' or 'clump'; centroid point guaranteed
 * to be at a cell of the given category.
 * 1 = Both 0 and 2 are run; if method 2 centroid is on
 * cell of proper cat, it is used, otherwise
 * method 1 value is substituted.
 * 2 = 'distance-weighted'; row = sigma(row)/n,
 * col = sigma(col)/n.
