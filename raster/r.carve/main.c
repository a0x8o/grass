/*
   Note: Use rast input type for rast output
   Read vect file,
   for each line,
   use a shadow line struct to represent stream profile,
   where x is distance along stream and y is elevation,
   adding each point to lobf as it's created.
   find trend using lobf
   from high to low, lower any points forming dams
   when next pnt elev increases,
   find next point <= than last confirmed pt
   just use linear interp for now
   write line to new raster
   Use orig line struct for XYs, shadow struct Y for cell val
   if new raster already has value there, use lower?
   actually probably want to use val for trunk stream
   and then verify branch in reverse
   - for now maybe create a conflict map
   After that's working, add width to lines?
   or use r.grow
