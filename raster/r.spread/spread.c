 *        This is a raster version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
 *        that is suited for simulating elliptical spread phenomena. It
 *                1) starts from each spread origin (stored in
 *                   a linked list of type costHa) - spread();
 *                2) selects appropriate cells as links for the current
 *                   spread cell and stored in a linked list of type
 *                   cell_ptrHa - select() ;
