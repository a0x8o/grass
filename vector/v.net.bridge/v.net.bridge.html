<p>
The output of the module contains the selected
features. For <b>method=bridge</b>, lines corresponding to
bridges are copied from the input map to the output map. On the
other hand, for <b>method=articulation</b>, points are created on
the positions of articulation points.
<p>

<br>In GRASS GIS, <em>line</em> is not always a single line
segment. It might be, and often is, a sequence of line segments
between two intersections. Also, articulation point is a standard
graph theoretic terminology which is slightly misleading in GRASS.
An articulation point in graph theory is an articulation
<em>node</em> in GRASS terminology.
