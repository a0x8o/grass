<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.connectivity</em> computes vertex connectivity between two sets,
 i.e. the minimum number of vertices whose removal would separate two
 given sets.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Two sets (<em>set1</em> and <em>set2</em>) are specified by respective
<b>layer</b>, <b>where</b> and <b>cats</b> parameters. Similarly to
<a href="v.net.flow.html">v.net.flow</a> module, capacities of nodes can
be given by <b>node_column</b> option. <em>v.net.connectivity</em> finds the
set of nodes of minimum total capacitiy separating the two given sets and
outputs map containing points on the positions of these nodes. Default
capacity, which is used when no column is specified, is one.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The following command finds the minimum number of intersections separating
