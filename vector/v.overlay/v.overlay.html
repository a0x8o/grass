<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.overlay</em> allows the user to overlay two vector maps. Features
in <b>ainput</b> can be lines or areas and are cut with areas in
<b>binput</b>. Simple <i>clipping</i> can be performed with the <b>and</b>
operator.
<p>
If areas in <b>ainput</b> are overlaid with areas in <b>binput</b>,
it is sometimes necessary to snap areas of <b>binput</b> to those of
<b>ainput</b>, otherwise areas can go missing or many sliver areas
can be created. Snapping is enabled by default and can be disabled by
setting the <b>snap</b> option to a negative value. Recommended values
are between 0.00000001 and 0.0001. Using larger values for snapping can
have undesired side-effects, but may sometimes be necessary to get a
clean output (see example below). In general, it is recommended to start
with a small snapping threshold, gradually increasing the threshold until
the result is reasonably clean. Snapping modifies only boundaries in
binput, which are snapped to boundaries in ainput. Boundaries in <b>ainput</b>
are not modified.
<!-- This is outdated
There are 3 links attached to features in output map,
<ul>
<li><b>field 1</b>: link to the new table, new table has 3 columns
    <ul>
        <li><b>cat</b> - key column linking rows to features
        <li><b>cata</b> - category of <i>afield</i> from <i>ainput</i>
        <li><b>catb</b> - category of <i>bfield</i> from <i>binput</i>
    </ul>
<li><b>field 2</b>: category of <i>afield</i> from <i>ainput</i>
<li><b>field 3</b>: category of <i>bfield</i> from <i>binput</i>
</ul>

<em>or</em> and <em>xor</em>! See also <em><a href="v.select.html">v.select</a></em>.

The operator defines what kind of operation will be done. Features are
written to output, if the result of an operation <b>ainput</b> operator <b>binput</b>
is true.

<p>
If the <i>first</i> number of the <b>olayer</b> option is greater than 0, then the
resulting output map has a merged attribute table in the given layer
number. The original column names have a prefix (<em>a_</em> and
<em>b_</em>) corresponding to <b>ainput</b> and <b>binput</b> map.
<p>
If the <i>second</i> number of the <b>olayer</b> option is greater than 0, then the
categories of <b>ainput</b> in layer <b>alayer</b> are transferred to
the output layer with the second number.
<p>
If the <i>third</i> number of the <b>olayer</b> option is greater than 0, then the
categories of <b>binput</b> in layer <em>blayer</em> are transferred to
the output layer with the third number.

<p>
If <b>atype</b>=auto is given than <em>v.overlay</em> determines
feature type for <b>ainput</b> from the first found feature.

<!-- This is outdated
<p><div class="code"><pre>
v.db.connect map=outputmap table=ainput.dbf field=2
v.db.connect map=outputmap table=binput.dbf field=3

</pre></div>

<p><b>Attention:</b> Removing the output map will also delete all tables linked to
it! Therefore it is advisable to copy tables from ainput and binput first and
connect the copied tables to the output map.-->

As can be seen by the resulting large number of centroids on boundaries,
the urban areas do not match exactly the Census 2000 areas. In this case
a clean result can be obtained by snapping with a threshold of 0.1 m.

<h3>Lines overlaid with polygons</h3>

Using the North Carolina sample dataset, we clip the roads map to the area
of city of Raleigh, preserving road attributes in layer 1:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region vector=zipcodes_wake

# extract Raleigh city:
v.extract in=zipcodes_wake out=raleigh where="ZIPNAME = 'RALEIGH'"

# clip road network to city polygon:
v.overlay ainput=roadsmajor atype=line binput=raleigh out=roadsmajor_raleigh operator=and olayer=0,1,0
</pre></div>

<center>
<img src="v_overlay_area_lines.png" alt="GRASS v.overlay: Line to polygon clipping"><br>
<table border=0 width=590>
<tr><td><center>
<i>Figure: v.overlay: Line to polygon clipping</i>
</center></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
