# The following environment variables are supposed to be passed to the build script
# - SRC: the directory where the grass source code lives
# - OSGEO4W_ROOT_MSYS: the root directory of OSGeo4W
# - UNITTEST: If this variable is defined, addition files for unittests are created
#
# By default, the script will look for the source code in the current directory
# and create bin.x86_64-w64-mingw32\grass$ver.bat (run this batch file to start
# GRASS GIS) and dist.x86_64-w64-mingw32\etc\env.bat.
