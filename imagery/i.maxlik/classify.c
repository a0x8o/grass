               definite (sometimes  called positive semi-definite), and this is
               a requirement of the maximum-likelihood estimator.  This
               assumption is  theoretically  true  for random samples of
               normally distributed data, but for imagery data this is not
               generally the  case.   The matrix  inversion/determinanat routine
               should  enforce positive semi-definiteness. I could not tell if
               it  did  this.   I  don't think  it does.  A necessary condition
               is that the determinant be positive but this is not sufficient.
               All  principal  minors  must also have non-negative determinants.
